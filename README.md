# Fixed StreamDeck Plugin for OctoPrint

This plugin is based on original https://github.com/cpeuschel/streamdeck-octodeck plugin with few bug fixes and tweaks.

- Bugs fixed: Now supports multible instances of the tile if you are controlling multible octoprints.
- Features: Added 10 second option as I felt 30sec wasn't fast enough.
